# Stellar Deception

Repo created to write down my ideas and worldbuilding of the Stellar Deception universe, it will be a visual novel/interactive story.

It will be massive, I'm thinking of 10-20 hours. I will make them seperate games due to optimization issues. So you will carry out your progress to next game via a code.

I already thinked about this universe for almost 2 years now, I even wrote 2 short interactive stories, but now it's time to actually start writing the whole universe.
